# About Me
Hi, this is Yizhen. I have a B.S. (2021) and a M.C.S. (2022) degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine (UCI). Currently, I am a software engineer at Motorola Solutions working for the Cloud Infrastructure Engineering department. An interesting thing about me is that C# is the first programming language that I used.
