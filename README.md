# About Me
Hi, this is Yizhen. I have a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine (UCI). I am also going to be graduated from UCI's Master of Computer Science in December 2022 too. My goal after my graduation is to work in a large corporation such as Google and Microsoft. An interesting thing about me is that C# is the first programming language that I used.
