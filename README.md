# About Me
Hi, you are checking out Yizhen now. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am currently a software engineer at Motorola Solutions working under the Core Platforms & Services (CPS) team. The focus of my profession is full stack development.

An interesting thing about me is that C# is the first programming language that I used.
